## Responsibilities

### All together

## Brief explanation

### Scenario

In our simple pubsub system, we use two terminals on the same machine to call the broker and start the pubsub.py. In the pubsub we create the subscribers and publisher and declare the topics and belonging messages. As well to which topics the subscribers subscribe. The expected result in the terminal is to get the right messages to the right subscribers for the right topic, as they can subscribe more than one topic with different ports.

### Programming language

We use python 3.11 and have no other dependencies.
